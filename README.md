# Welcome

This is what I call OPUS. 
I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on my hard drive so I started recycling and interconnecting them.
Maybe we can create something useful together and in the open.

While I am "the curator", some of this is not my own thought. Please help me find and credit the sources.
